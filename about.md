### About Me

My name is Yuanpin Zhou. I'm a rookie data scientist. I like reading and watching movies besides doing research. My favorite NBA team is the Golden State Warriors. I enjoy Joe Lacob's vision, Steve Kerr's leadership, the selfless and joyful culture, and their beautiful basketball movement.

This blog is about machine learning, programming, and everything else.
