The presence of lymph node metastases is one of the most important factors in breast cancer prognosis. The most common strategy to assess the regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed and examined by the pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine learning algorithm, are able to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. 

To train machine learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. We released a dataset of **1399 annotated whole-slide images** of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in total three terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from **five different medical centers** to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each whole-slide image has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for **209 whole-slide images, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided**. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available. A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use.

## Data Description

### CAMELYON16[^c16]

#### Dataset Structure

The data in this challenge contains **a total of 399 whole-slide images (WSIs)** of sentinel lymph node from two independent data sets collected in Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen, The Netherlands), and the University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, The Netherlands). **270 WSIs (159 normal + 111 tumor)** were divided into *training set*. **129 WSIs** were divided into *testing set*.

#### Annotations

The shared XML files are compatible with the [ASAP](https://github.com/GeertLitjens/ASAP) software. You may download this software and visualize the annotations overlaid on the whole slide image.

The provided XML files may have three groups of annotations ("_0", "_1", or "_2") which can be accessed from the "**PartOfGroup**" attribute of the Annotation node in the XML file. Annotations belonging to group "_0" and "_1" represent tumor areas and annotations within group "_2" are non-tumor areas which have been cut-out from the original annotations in the first two group.

All the images except for the ones mentioned below are fully annotated (all tumor areas have been exhaustively annotated). The annotations for the images listed below are not exhaustive. In other words, there might be tumor areas in these slides which have not been annotated. Most of these slides contain two consecutive sections of the same tissue. In those cases one section is typically exhaustively annotated.:

* tumor_010
* tumor_015
* tumor_018
* tumor_020
* tumor_025
* tumor_029
* tumor_033
* tumor_034
* tumor_044
* tumor_046
* tumor_051
* tumor_054
* tumor_055
* tumor_056
* tumor_067
* tumor_079: Blurred tumor region is not annotated.
* tumor_085
* tumor_092: Blurred tumor region on the adjacent tissue is not annotated.
* tumor_095
* tumor_110

The following files have been intentionally removed from the original data set:

* normal_86: Originally misclassified, renamed to tumor_111.
* test_049: Duplicate slide.

Test set notes:

* test_114: Does not have exhaustive annotations.

### CAMELYON17[^c17]

#### Dataset Structure

The data in this challenge contains a total of **1000 whole-slide images (WSIs)** of sentinel lymph node from 5 different medical centers from The Netherlands. The data set is divided into training and testing sets with 20 patients from each center in both sets. For each patient the shared 5 whole-slide images are zipped together into a single ZIP file. The patient pN-stages and the slide-level labels in the training set are shared in the *stage_labels.csv* file.

#### Annotations

From each center 10 slides are exhaustively annotated and the annotations are shared in XML format. The XML files are compatible with the [ASAP](https://github.com/GeertLitjens/ASAP) software. You may download this software and visualize the annotations overlaid on the whole slide image.

The provided XML files may have two groups of annotations ("metastases", or "normal") which can be accessed from the "**PartOfGroup**" attribute of the Annotation node in the XML file. Annotations belonging to group "metastases" represent tumor areas and annotations within group "normal" are non-tumor areas which have been cut-out from the original annotations in the "metastases" group.
